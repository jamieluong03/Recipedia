# Recipedia

This app is for users who are inventive and love to cook. Users can share their creative, home-made recipes by submitting a form that asks for the Recipe Name, Cuisine, Preparation Time, Ingredients, Servings, Instructions, and an image of their picture that's uploaded online! Each of the recipes are sorted by their cuisine type. By searching for a specific cuisine, the database can pull up all the submitted recipes that belong to that cuisine.
