# Recipedia

In this app, users who are inventive and love to cook could share their creative recipes by adding it to the database and recalling the recipes when needed. The users are able to add the Recipe Name, Cuisine, Preparation Time, Ingredients, Servings, Instructions, and an image of their picture that's uploaded online! When recalling recipes, they are sorted by the type of cuisine it belongs to, such as American, Italian, Chinese, etc.
